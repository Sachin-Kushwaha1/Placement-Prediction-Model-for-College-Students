# Student Placement Prediction

## Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a student will be placed in a job after graduation. The model considers factors like CGPA, internships, projects, certifications, extracurricular activities, and aptitude/mock interview scores.

**Key Features:**

*   Predictive Model: Employs a trained machine learning model (`placement_model.pkl`) to forecast placement outcomes.
*   User-Friendly Interface: Features a simple web application built with Flask, enabling users to input student data and receive instant predictions.
*   Scalable and Accessible: The application is designed to be easily deployed and accessible to students and placement cells.

## Project Structure

*   `app.py`: Contains the Flask application code for handling user input, prediction logic, and rendering results.
*   `index.html`: Defines the structure and layout of the web page, including the input form and prediction display.
*   `placement_model.pkl`: The trained machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) saved for prediction.
*   `scaler.pkl`: The scaler object used to preprocess input data before feeding it to the model.
*   `placement_data.csv`: The dataset used to train the model (sample data provided).
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies (Flask, joblib, scikit-learn, etc.).

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/placement-prediction.git`
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Run the Flask app: `python app.py`
4.  Access the web application in your browser (typically at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`)
5.  Fill in the student's information in the form.
6.  Click "Predict" to see the prediction.

## Model Development

The model was trained on a dataset of student information (see `placement_data.csv`). The following steps were involved:

1.  Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and outlier detection.
2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Correlation analysis and visualizations to understand feature relationships.
3.  Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model accuracy (e.g., combining internships and projects).
4.  Model Building: Training various algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM).
5.  Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
6.  Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters using techniques like GridSearchCV.

## Future Enhancements

*   Incorporate more nuanced data points (e.g., leadership roles, hackathon participation).
*   Experiment with deep learning models for potentially higher accuracy.
*   Integrate model interpretability techniques (SHAP, LIME) to provide personalized insights.
